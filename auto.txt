</p> <p> <b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Rachel ann Tiongco and I was born on the 12th of August, 2000 in Valladolid Negros Occidental and I’m 18 years old. My parents were Raymund Tiongco and Rosie Tiongco and I have a younger brother his name is Aeign Zackrey Nash Tiongco. I am currently studying in Carlos Hilado Memorial State College and I’m taking up BS information Technology. I’m going to tell the story of my life.</b></p><p>

<p> <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I faced a lot of challenges in life, one of them is family problem. When I was young until my junior high school ends, my parents are always fighting, they are yelling and shouting to each other, breaking things, and sometimes it leads them to hurt each other. I have a younger brother before Nash came to us and his name is also Raymund and he was a junior of my father but unfortunately when he was still a baby he passed away he was able to be with us for only 4 weeks I think, he didn’t even live for 1 month and I’m very young that time. They said he was very weak because when he was still in my mother’s womb, my mother was always stress because that time my parents are always fighting and arguing. They told me that he’s fighting to live but unfortunately he didn’t survive, it was a very painful event in our life. But, I believe that “Everything happens for a reason” and God knows what’s best for each of us. Maybe it happens because there is a reason.</b> </p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also a challenge personally like I don’t want people to see me sad especially my family. So, when my parents are fighting I am hiding to a place where no one will saw me and in that place I cry my heart out but now I’m very thankful and grateful that my parents has changed, they are not fighting anymore they are just talking to each other calmly when there is a problem that they need to talk to. 
I’m a very shy person also and I don’t talk immediately with people, it takes time for me to engage and interact with them. They said that I’m an introvert person and, I saw that personality in myself also sometimes, but now I’m really doing my best to interact with people and show them the funny and outgoing side of me.

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growing up facing different challenges in life has taught me a lot of lesson. Like what C.S. Lewis said, “You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending”. I must learn to interact with people and make the most of my life because time will pass anyway, there’s a lot of chances I know, but the thing is how do I will spend my life, is it creating it with what I want and live with it or living it with what I don’t want, I have always the choice. And, it is one of the lesson I have learnt. Also One said, “Everything happens for a reason. That reason causes change. Sometimes it hurts. Sometimes it’s hard. But, in the end, it’s all for the best. Never stop trusting God and believing in His plan” and I strongly believe in that.</b></p>
