<tr>
<td colspan="5" style="font-family: century "> <p> <b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Rachel ann Tiongco and I was born on the 12th of August, 2000 in Valladolid Negros Occidental and I’m 18 years old. My parents were Raymund Tiongco and Rosie Tiongco and I have a younger brother his name is Aeign Zackrey Nash Tiongco. I am currently studying in Carlos Hilado Memorial State University and I’m taking up BS in information Technology. I’m going to tell the story of my life.</b></p>
<p> <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I faced a lot of challenges in life. I have a younger brother before Nash came to us and his name is also Raymund and he was a junior of my father but unfortunately when he was still a baby he passed away, he was able to be with us for only 4 weeks, I think, he didn’t even get to live for 1 month and I’m very young at that time. They said he was very weak because when he was still in my mother’s womb, my mother was always stress because that time my parents are always fighting and arguing. They told me that he’s fighting to live but unfortunately he didn’t survive, it was a very painful event in our life. But, I believe that “Everything happens for a reason” and God is the only oe who know what’s best for us. Maybe it happens because there is a reason.</b> </p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also have a personal struggle like I don’t want people to see me sad or weak, especially my family. So, when my parents are fighting I tend to hide in a place where no one will saw me, and in that place I will cry my heart out, but now I’m very thankful and grateful that my parents has changed, they are not fighting anymore they are just talking to each other calmly when there is a problem that they need to talk to. 
I’m a very shy person as well and I don't even know why, and I don’t talk immediately with people, it takes time for me to engage and interact with them. They said that I’m an introvert and I saw that personality in myself also sometimes, but now I’m really doing my best to interact with people and show them the funny and outgoing side of me.
</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growing up facing different challenges and struggles in life has taught me a lot of lesson. Like what C.S. Lewis said, “You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending”. I must learn to interact with people and make the most of my life because time will pass anyway, there’s a lot of chances and oppurtunities I know that, but the thing is how will I spend my life, its either doing what I want and live with it or living it just to survive and without happiness. I always have the choice and its up to me, but most of the time life gets harder and I must sacrifice doing what I want. And, it is one of the lesson I have learnt. Also someone said, “Everything happens for a reason. That reason causes change. Sometimes it hurts. Sometimes its hard. But, in the end, it’s all for the best. Never stop trusting God and believe in His plan and I strongly believe in that.</b></p>
